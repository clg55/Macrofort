MACROFORT FOR MAPLE 6 and above source code

MACROFORT TEST
**************

"macrotest.mpl" and "testout.ref"

The file "macrotest.mpl" tests all the features of Macrofort.
It has to be read into Maple. A file named "testout" is then created.
It must be identical to the file "testout.ref".
Note that it is possible that the test is OK and "test.f" is not
identical to "test.f.ref". This can be for random reasons, for
instance such as exchanged lines.

You need to load Macrofort before executing the test.
